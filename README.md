# Blockchain-Based-Ledger-System

A blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This application allows users to add transactions to a blockchain between a sender and receiver with a selected amount, validate the blockchain, change the level of difficulty for the proof of work algorithm validating the blocks, and inspect each block in the blockchain. Each block is hashed using the SHA256 Algorithm.
